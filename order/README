This is a collection of queries that query aspects of the Wikidata ontology.

Many of the queries were used in a research project to quantify problems in the Wikidata ontology related to class order.  A paper was written on this effort and will be avilable in arXiv soon.

This is not a fair set of queries.  Many of the queries were constructed to get around limitations in QLever.

Many of the queries are hard, running for close to a minute in QLever and timing out in the WDQS.

The queries are organized into groupings, each in its on subdirectory:

  top     queries that start at some universal class for a class order and find the roots of or all classes of a particular fixed order
  loop    queries that look for instance loops
  bottom  queries that determine minimum class order based on instance chains
  split	  queries that find pairs where the first is both an instance and a subclasses of the second
  misc	  other queries

queries.tsv in this directory combines queries.tsv in each of the subdirectorie
